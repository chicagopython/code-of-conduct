*note: prefer the tiny reference above except on printed material where
 hyperlinks are not useful*

The Chicago Python User Group community is made up of active members with a
diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.
We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an
environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference. 
Accordingly, we expect all attendees to show respect and courtesy to other
attendees at all ChiPy events.

All attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any
ChiPy event must conform to our Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce
this code throughout our events.

**Our full code of conduct can be found at:**
http://www.chipy.org/pages/conduct/ 

**Here is the short version:**

- All communication should remain appropriate for a professional audience
  including people of many different backgrounds.
- When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- We consider sexual language or imagery inappropriate in any venue
  including talks.
- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
- Behave professionally. We consider harassment and sexist, racist,
  or exclusionary jokes inappropriate.

Chipy organizers may ask any attendees violating these rules to leave the event.
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly environment for all.

**Contact information:**

If you feel harassed, witness harassment, or have other concerns,
please contact a member of the ChiPy Code of Conduct Committee
(chipy.conduct@gmail.com).  If you consider the matter especially
urgent, please talk to the on call member on duty right away —
they will be introduced at the beginning of each event.

Or if you feel uncomfortable speaking in person, you can make an
anonymous report to chipy.conduct@gmail.com at a time that is
convenient.

A Chipy organizer or representative can help participants contact security
or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe during the event.
We value your attendance.
