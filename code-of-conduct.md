# Code of Conduct

The Chicago Python User Group(ChiPy) community is made up of active members
from the greater Chicago-land areas and participating virtually with a
diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through this
diversity that our community experiences great successes and continued
growth.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all
participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all
participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants at
all ChiPy events.

To make clear what is expected, all participants, speakers, sponsors,
organizers, and volunteers at any ChiPy event are required to conform to the
following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code at every event.

## Our Standards

ChiPy is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless
of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or
lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of event participants in any form
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- Sexual language and imagery in any event venue, including talks, Slack,
Twitter, or other online media
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Excessive swearing
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the
event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
the offender or expulsion from the event (without refund, if applicable) and
banning from future events.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

### Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at ChiPy venues, including but not limited to explosives
(including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or
display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or
harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked
to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this
matter.

## Scope

All ChiPy attendees are subject to the Code of Conduct. This includes ChiPy
organizers and volunteers, as well as attendees of the talk events,
collaborative work environments, receptions / after-party events, or other
sponsored or unofficial events related to ChiPy events.

## Contact Information

For any issues under this code, or questions about it, please contact the ChiPy
organizers at (chicago-organizers@python.org) or approach any of the organizers
directly in person or on Slack.

Organizers of ChiPy will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist any
attendee to feel safe during ChiPy events. We value your attendance.
